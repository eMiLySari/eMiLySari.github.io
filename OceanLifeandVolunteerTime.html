<h2>Ocean LIfe and My volunteering time</h2> 
<p>Ocean life:
Many animals and creatures in the deep blue waters that surrounds our mother earth, are suffering the consequences of human being waste. For example trash can cause health problems and even death for these beautiful creatures. Also, ocean pollution is not the solution for saving this creatures. I want that this creatures are still there in the blue oceans for the future and beyond. I aspire that if every person in the whole earth does something nice for ocean wildlife, fear of the ocean creatures would be no more. </p> 

<h2>Volunteering time:</h2>
<p>To save the creatures in the seas we can pick up trash at the beach. I volunteer at the 30 minute beach clean up and it very fun by knowing that you're helping animals keep alive and stay alive. </p>
